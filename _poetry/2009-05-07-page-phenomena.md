<pre class="poetry">
If this were

           BOTTLECAP

       flung here by a passing truck,
   it would lump-lie idly
       chewing on these lines with rusty teeth.

 If this were

                ANT

       on its daily foray,
   it would scurry from the scrawling
       pen into BOTTLECAP-shadow
   then away, fearing
       musing, abstracted fingertips

may transform

   IT (WERE)

       into

           HE (WAS)

       into

           BLOT.
