<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/27/l_6e6ac7f64d4ece4956b3e46d8877d8fb.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 300px; height: 307px;" src="http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/27/l_6e6ac7f64d4ece4956b3e46d8877d8fb.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>This  poem was inspired by a photograph of a MySpace friend, Shel, that she captioned "<span id="caption"><span id="ctl00_ctl00_cpMain_cpMain_UserViewPictureControl_ImageListings1_dlImageList_ctl10_lblCaption">w/my first boyfriend." You probably won't be able to see the poem in the photo, but perhaps you can catch a glimpse of the photo in the poem. I'm not sure how well my intended meaning comes across here, nor whether that matters. Hopefully, you'll get something from it of your own. After all, it's poetry.<hr /><br /></span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fingerprints</span><br /><br />Once, the furrows of my fingertips<br />traced your lips, sowing<br />everywhere I touched, fingerprints<br />you gathered and wound into your hair.<br /><br />As our images ebbed into celluloid<br />cast against the well-worn screen,<br />we grew translucent, tricks of light<br />fading in the electric relentless glare,<br />casting no fingerprints.<span id="caption"><span id="ctl00_ctl00_cpMain_cpMain_UserViewPictureControl_ImageListings1_dlImageList_ctl10_lblCaption"><br /></span></span>
