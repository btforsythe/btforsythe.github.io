As obvious a statement as it seems, I've come to the conclusion that to learn to write better poetry, I'd better learn to read (better?) poetry. On a tangential note, it also turns out that public libraries let just about anyone in and let him borrow books. In my browsing, I discovered Edward Hirsch's <i>How to Read a Poem: And Fall in Love with Poetry</i>. I haven't read enough of it to give an opinion. What I can give is a quotation I stumbled over while flipping through that floored me (or would have, had I not been conveniently sitting on the floor in the stacks).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0151004196?ie=UTF8&tag=mortameasuinm-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0151004196"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 300px;" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_K5FHPFHIZOM/Sco3nHUUsSI/AAAAAAAAAFM/cKRb1yJv2Ds/0156005662.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_%5B1%5D.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mortameasuinm-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0151004196" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />I've been struggling with the nature of a poem, the purpose of a poem, the end of a poem, so this struck close to home. I hadn't even <span style="font-weight: bold;">heard</span> of Paul Valéry until I ran across this. (There go my literary credentials!) I take it from my exhaustive research (I googled it) that this particular quote was (translated?) from a lecture he gave in 1939 at Oxford. Were he a hack, though, this would be none the worse for it:<br /><br />"A poet's function—do not be startled by this remark—is not to experience the poetic state: that is a private affair. His function is to create it in others."<br /><br />Many parts of this book were originally published in magazine columns. Poetry Foundation has <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/features/feature.guidebook.hirsch.html">reprinted the first chapter from the book</a>. They even broke it down into easy-to-consume-via-browser sections.
