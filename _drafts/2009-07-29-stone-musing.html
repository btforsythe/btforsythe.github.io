I can sit across the table while<br />you ravage biryani, bask in<br />your introductions, rest in your palm<br />while you wrong-shoes-stumble<br />along leafy trails hoping<br />to trip you, taste your sole,<br />and remain a stone.<br /><br />I can sit among spices<br />over-warm on the shelf, eloquently<br />hung above gas-flame,<br />taste zucchini, onions almost-minced, tomatoes<br />soaking up the olive oil<br />and remain a stone.<br /><br />I can sit in a worn wooden seat,<br />consort with your laughing<br />eyes sipping coffee, be<br />thrown<br />through a doorway,<br />railed against,<br />sit smoking<br />at a caf√© table just outside,<br />pulsing<br />with that tireless drummer's<br />aftermath<br />and remain a stone.<br /><br />I can sit, stoic, thinking stubborn<br />stone oblivion thoughts,<br />breathing<br />lies into my shadow, empty<br />object of my pity,<br />my derision,<br />my envy.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><i>Special thanks go to C. and M. for helping me worry out this thorn.</i>
