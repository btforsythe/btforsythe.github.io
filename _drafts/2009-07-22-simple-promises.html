Promise me my ivory tower will remain<br />a bar of soap, slippery soaked<br />in tears of frustration<br />from shins knocked against the dashboard,<br />splinters picked from soft spots in fingertips, spurring<br />my tongue to simple, sharp, short words,<br />dictionary spurned.<br /><br />Promise me I'll treat them as friends, strip paint with curses,<br />and never forget them.
