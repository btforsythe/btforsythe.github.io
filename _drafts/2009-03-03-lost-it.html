Not sure when it was that I wrote this one, would need to dig through old MySpace blogs.  I'd guess sometime in the summer of 2007 or thereabouts.  (My MySpace blog, if you're not familiar, is @ http://blog.myspace.com/megasycophant, though it will be mostly going away now.)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lost it!</span><br /><br />I saw a poem today.<br />Heard it first, actually.<br />Just so happened<br />it had managed to get stuck in my ear.<br /><br />I could smell it dangling there,<br />wanting to be frankincense and myrrh<br />but really just sweat<br />and cheap incense.<br /><br />Made me wonder<br />if it would be bitter or astringent.<br />Oughta give it a good lick.<br /><br />So...<br /><br />I made a grab,<br />but with a desparate twist,<br />it flipped its whimsy<br />and skittered across the floor,<br />cracked a window with its poignant wit<br />and ran free<br />(as well as it could, anyway<br />dragging so much angst).
