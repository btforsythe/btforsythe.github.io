I wake, the warm half of a footprint<br />stomped into the underbelly of the kitten<br /><br />who, meowling, rasps its tongue<br />across my eyelids,<br />along my grain from tip to root,<br />into my pungent furrows.<br /><br />Disconsolate, it drags its belly across my stomach<br />to lie silently on my chest and grow cold.<br /><br />***************************<br /><br />I definitely don't like the titleâ€”I'll be changing that.
