One of my favorites by far, the sorta thing I look at and say "hey, maybe I should just quit now!"<br /><br /><b>Love Poem</b><br /><br />love, squandered<br />coins slipping through threadworn<br />holes in carefree children's pockets,<br />from the threadbare drag<br />of whores stumbling and swaying<br />spraddle-legged down the pavement,<br />face-down, unlucky, in the mud<br />or on their backs, lucky, ground<br />into the street beneath surging traffic<br />in squandered coins, best for what ails you,<br />quick fix, him that's got, wants<br />more because it tastes of honey<br />but its bouquet is astringent,<br />not sweet like the flowers<br />before they went to rot,<br />only vintage they pour in this establishment<br />all night, trading it for squandered coins<br /><br />wishing I had a glass<br /><br />       B.
