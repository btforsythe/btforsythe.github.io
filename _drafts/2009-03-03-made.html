This tumbled out almost fully formed, as my better poems seem to, my subconscious the better poet.<br /><br />Made<br /><br />Chew your boy slowly — it would NOT do<br />for him to stick in your throat.<br />Count!<br />You would do well to follow the prescribed count as you chew.<br />Do not fret if he's squeamish.  These doubts will pass,<br />he was bred to this purpose.<br /><br />We warn that you make sure his feet are clad softly.<br />If a pulsing cadence is experienced, this should not cause alarm;<br />his training does not leave him in the gullet — he places one foot after another yet!<br /><br />Our guidelines will lead you to satisfaction<br />or we guarantee your money back.<br /><br />        B.
